This file or program is exactly what it sounds like.. DoS attack.
When you start the program it will ask you for target. After you give it target it starts 10 ping -f spams on the target which should be enough to turn it off... Exactly how DoS should.
I need to say to don't use it on people or targets that did not give you permision to DoS them.

Its quite simple program.
