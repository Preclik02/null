## IDEK
So I kinda made my own basic IDE it is not nearly perfect but it was good experience creating it.
I made it mainly to flex on making my own IDE and not using nano or others.
Also its good because I can define how it will act so it was pretty worthy.
For it to be running smoothly you will just need nullc or not need but it's recommended.
I guess that is all I can say about it it is really simple.
If you feel like you want to understand the code or just ask something about it contact me.
