**Null**
This is the main program of this whole toolset the idea behind this is to have some project of mine to be ready with future NullOS.
The null has a lot of commands the help command is clear and the toolset is being frequently updated.

If you have some ideas or bugs on your mind don't be afraid to make issue.
