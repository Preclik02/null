**NULL**
This is part of the NullOS tool set.

**Instalation**
Install it on web in description of this repo or download the install.sh
If you want manual install than make sure all of the files and directories exist as in the repo and the nc folder is in path.


*notes* --> If you are not installing with install.sh than make directory ~/.null/cache/ssh. Null also saves your commands into a filename of your username in cache folder and sends them to setted sshfs server YOU SET.
